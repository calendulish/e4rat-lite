=head1 NAME

e4rat-lite-realloc - Reallocation and defragmentation of relevant files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<e4rat-lite-realloc>  B<[> option(s) B<]> B<[> mode B<]> file(s)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

e4rat-lite-realloc is a relevant file defrag program based on EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT ioctl from ext4 filesystems. It physically places files into a sequence of neighbouring blocks on disk. The reallocation process can be done when the filesystem is still mounted. For security reasons write access to each file is needed.

If you want to process files from a program it is recommended to kill them at first. Linux does not allow to open files writable while it is still executed. So it is not possible to process the program executable binary. Those files get excluded automatically.

Add list files to be proceeded either as parameters and/or over stdin. The list I<file(s)> must be in a format generated by e4rat-lite-collect.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -V --version

show version information and exit.

=item -h --help

display usage message and exit.

=item -v --verbose

increment verbosity level.

=item -q --quiet

set verbosity level to 0. This means that no messages will be displayed.

=item -l --loglevel <number>

set loglevel to <number>. All log messages are sent either to the Kernel log (see dmesg(1)) or to syslog(3).

=head1 DEFRAG MODES

Use the configuration file to change the defragmentation modes

=item Preallocation (pa)

use the pre-allocation ioctl to rearrange files on disk. Furthermore this mode supports to eliminate gaps of unallocated blocks in sparse files. Unfortunately, this ioctl is presently under heavy development by Kazuya Mio and has not yet entered the Linux Kernel. Therefore you have to apply this Kernel patch fist:

Do this at your own risk.

=item locality group

The ext4 filesystem allocates small files in so-called locality groups. Each CPU manages its own group. 
The "locality-group" method makes use of this feature in order to rearrange the files on disk. In contrast to the "prealloc" method, no kernel patch is required. However, the placement may me suboptimal.
While creating donor files is in progress, it is necessary to increase the limit which indicates small files. 
As a result other allocation requests occurring at the same time will be also satisfied with blocks from the locality group as well. It is the best if you just avoid heavy write access to disk.

=item Top level directory (tld)

With this method, all donor files are created in a new top level directory.
The so-called Orlov algorithm put top level directory into an empty block group. As a result, donor files will be allocated near this directory. But there is no guarantee that the donor files are allocated in their access order. 

Also, ext4's block allocator normalizes every block request to a power of 2. This typically leads to small holes between the files.
